Ruby2js
=======

Minimal yet extensible Ruby to JavaScript conversion.

Description
---

The base package maps Ruby syntax to JavaScript semantics.  For example,
a Ruby Hash literal becomes a JavaScript Object literal.  Ruby symbols
become JavaScript strings.  Ruby method calls become JavaScript function
calls IF there are either one or more arguments passed OR parenthesis are
used, otherwise Ruby method calls become JavaScript property accesses.
By default, methods and procs return `undefined`.

Ruby attribute accessors, methods defined with no parameters and no
parenthesis, as well as setter method definitions, are
mapped to
[Object.defineProperty](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=JavaScript%2FReference%2FGlobal_Objects%2FObject%2FdefineProperty),
so avoid these if you wish to target users running IE8 or lower. 

Filters may be provided to add Ruby-specific or framework specific
behavior.  Filters are essentially macro facilities that operate on
an AST representation of the code.

See
[notimplemented_spec](https://github.com/rubys/ruby2js/blob/master/spec/notimplemented_spec.rb)
for a list of Ruby features _known_ to be not implemented.

Synopsis
---

Basic:

```ruby
require 'ruby2js'
puts Ruby2JS.convert("a={age:3}\na.age+=1")
```

With filter:

```ruby
require 'ruby2js/filter/functions'
puts Ruby2JS.convert('"2A".to_i(16)')
```

With [ExecJS](https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs):
```ruby
require 'ruby2js/execjs'
require 'date'

context = Ruby2JS.compile(Date.today.strftime('d = new Date(%Y, %-m-1, %-d)'))
puts context.eval('d.getYear()')+1900
```

Conversions can be explored interactively using the
[demo](https://github.com/rubys/ruby2js/blob/master/demo/ruby2js.rb) provided.

Introduction
---

JavaScript is a language where `0` is considered `false`, strings are
immutable, and the behaviors for operators like `==` are, at best,
[convoluted](http://zero.milosz.ca/).

Any attempt to bridge the semantics of Ruby and JavaScript will involve
trade-offs.  Consider the following expression:

```ruby
a[-1]
```

Programmers who are familiar with Ruby will recognize that this returns the
last element (or character) of an array (or string).  However, the meaning is
quite different if `a` is a Hash.

One way to resolve this is to change the way indexing operators are evaluated,
and to provide a runtime library that adds properties to global JavaScript
objects to handle this.  This is the approach that [Opal](http://opalrb.org/)
takes.  It is a fine approach, with a number of benefits.  It also has some
notable drawbacks.  For example,
[readability](http://opalrb.org/try/#code:a%20%3D%20%22abc%22%3B%20puts%20a[-1])
and 
[compatibility with other frameworks](https://github.com/opal/opal/issues/400).

Another approach is to simply accept JavaScript semantics for what they are.
This would mean that negative indexes would return `undefined` for arrays
and strings.  This is the base approach provided by ruby2js.

A third approach would be to do static transformations on the source in order
to address common usage patterns or idioms.  These transformations can even be
occasionally unsafe, as long as the transformations themselves are opt-in.
ruby2js provides a number of such filters, including one that handles negative
indexes when passed as a literal.  As indicated above, this is unsafe in that
it will do the wrong thing when it encounters a hash index which is expressed
as a literal constant negative one.  My experience is that such is rare enough
to be safely ignored, but YMMV.  More troublesome, this also won’t work when
the index is not a literal (e.g., `a[n]`) and the index happens to be
negative at runtime.

This quickly gets into gray areas.  `each` in Ruby is a common method that
facilitates iteration over arrays.  `forEach` is the JavaScript equivalent.
Mapping this is fine until you start using a framework like jQuery which
provides a function named [each](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/).

Fortunately, Ruby provides `?` and `!` as legal suffixes for method names,
Ruby2js filters do an exact match, so if you select a filter that maps `each`
to `forEach`, `each!` will pass through the filter.  The final code that emits
JavaScript function calls and parameter accesses will strip off these
suffixes.

Static transformations and runtime libraries aren't aren’t mutually exclusive.
With enough of each, one could reproduce any functionality desired.  Just be
forewarned, that implementing a function like `method_missing` would require a
_lot_ of work.

Integrations
---

While this is a low level library suitable for DIY integration, one of the
obvious uses of a tool that produces JavaScript is by web servers.  Ruby2JS
includes three such integrations:

*  [CGI](https://github.com/rubys/ruby2js/blob/master/lib/ruby2js/cgi.rb)
*  [Sinatra](https://github.com/rubys/ruby2js/blob/master/lib/ruby2js/sinatra.rb)
*  [Rails](https://github.com/rubys/ruby2js/blob/master/lib/ruby2js/rails.rb)

As you might expect, CGI is a bit sluggish.  By contrast, Sinatra and Rails
are quite speedy as the bulk of the time is spend on the initial load of the
required libraries.

Filters
---

In general, making use of a filter is as simple as requiring it.  If multiple
filters are selected, they will all be applied in parallel in one pass through
the script.

* <a id="strict" href="https://github.com/rubys/ruby2js/blob/master/lib/ruby2js/filter/strict.rb">strict</a>
  adds `'use strict';` to the output.

* <a id="return" href="https://github.com/rubys/ruby2js/blob/master/lib/ruby2js/filter/return.rb">return</a>
  adds `return` to the last expression in functions.

* <a id="require" href="https://github.com/rubys/ruby2js/blob/master/lib/ruby2js/filter/require.rb">require</a>
  supports `require` and `require_relative` statements.  Contents of files
  that are required are converted to JavaScript and expanded inline.
  `require` function calls in expressions are left alone.

* <a id="camelCase" href="https://github.com/rubys/ruby2js/blob/master/lib/ruby2js/filter/camelCase.rb">camelCase</a>
  converts `underscore_case` to `camelCase`.  See
  [camelCase_spec](https://github.com/rubys/ruby2js/blob/master/spec/camelCase_spec.rb)
  for examples.

If you simply want to get a job done, and would like a mature and tested
framework, and only use one of the many integrations that
[Opal](http://opalrb.org/) provides, then Opal is the way to go right now.

ruby2js is for those that want to produce JavaScript that looks like it
wasn’t machine generated, and want the absolute bare minimum in terms of
limitations as to what JavaScript can be produced.

[Try](http://intertwingly.net/projects/ruby2js/all) for yourself.
[Compare](http://opalrb.org/try/#code:).

And, of course, the right solution might be to use
[CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) instead.
